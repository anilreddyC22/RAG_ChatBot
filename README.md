In this Project I'll walk you through the process of building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain.

Build a production-ready RAG chatbot that can answer questions based on your own documents using Langchain. 
This comprehensive tutorial guides you through creating a multi-user chatbot with FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend, covering both theory and hands-on implementation.

1)Introduction to RAG: 
We will learn the fundamentals of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and understand its significance in modern AI applications.

2)Working with LangChain: 
Get hands-on experience with LangChain, exploring its core components such as large language models (LLMs), prompts, and retrievers.

3)Document Processing: 
Master the process of splitting, embedding, and storing documents in vector databases to enable efficient retrieval.

4)Building RAG Chains: 
Develop your first RAG chain capable of answering document-based questions, and advance to creating conversational AI systems that manage complex interactions.

5)Contextualizing and refining queries: 
How to refine queries using conversation history, making your AI system more accurate and responsive.

6)Conversational RAG: 
Implement a chatbot to apply these concepts practically and manage conversation history using databases.



--> What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Def : RAG is a technique that enhances language models by combining them with a retrieval system. It allows the model to access and utilize external knowledge when generating responses.

The process typically involves:
Indexing a large corpus of documents

Retrieving relevant information based on the input query

Using the retrieved information to augment the prompt sent to the language model

->Overview of Langchain :-

Langchain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a set of tools and abstractions that make it easier to build complex AI applications. Key features include:

Modular components for common LLM tasks

Built-in support for various LLM providers

Tools for document loading, text splitting, and vector storage

Abstractions for building conversational agents and question-answering systems


--> LangChain Components and Expression Language (LCEL)
LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is a key feature that makes working with LangChain components flexible and powerful. Let's explore how LCEL is used with various components:
